🦾 Robotics R&D Intern — Boston Dynamics (Simulation & Control Systems)

Location: Waltham, MA | On-site
Program Duration: 12 Weeks | Summer 2026
Reports to: Senior Robotics Engineer

About the Role

Boston Dynamics builds the world’s most advanced mobile robots. As a Robotics R&D Intern, you’ll join a multidisciplinary team developing next-generation motion control, perception, and planning systems. You’ll help bridge simulation and real hardware through rapid prototyping, testing, and data-driven iteration on platforms like Spot, Stretch, and experimental humanoids.

What You’ll Do

Design, test, and tune control algorithms for dynamic locomotion, manipulation, or perception subsystems.

Develop and validate simulation models using MATLAB, Python, or C++ with physics engines (MuJoCo, Gazebo, Isaac Sim).

Analyze sensor data (IMU, LiDAR, stereo vision) for calibration and system feedback.

Support real-world experiments, safety protocols, and data collection for control validation.

Collaborate with electrical and mechanical engineers to integrate new hardware into test rigs.

Document designs, experiments, and test results for internal R&D reviews.

What We’re Looking For

Currently pursuing a B.S./M.S. in Robotics, Mechanical/Electrical/Computer Engineering, or Applied Math.

Strong foundation in dynamics, control systems, and linear algebra.

Proficiency in Python, C++, or MATLAB.

Familiarity with ROS 2, real-time control loops, or simulation frameworks.

Demonstrated ability to design experiments and interpret quantitative results.

Comfortable debugging hardware–software interfaces.

Bonus Skills

Hands-on experience with embedded microcontrollers or motor control boards.

Experience in reinforcement learning or model-predictive control for robotics.

Exposure to CAD and mechanical prototyping (SolidWorks, Onshape).

Why Boston Dynamics?

You’ll learn directly from the engineers shaping the future of robotics — where math, mechanics, and code converge. Your work may directly contribute to new behaviors in our next generation of agile machines.

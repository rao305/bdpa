🎮 Game Design Intern — Epic Games

Location: Cary, NC | Hybrid / On-site
Program Duration: 12 weeks | Summer 2026
Reports to: Senior Game Designer

About the Role

As a Game Design Intern at Epic Games, you’ll collaborate with experienced designers, engineers, and artists to craft gameplay experiences that define Epic’s worlds — from Fortnite to Unreal-powered prototypes. You’ll learn how world-class AAA development teams turn ideas into playable reality and contribute directly to live or experimental projects.

What You’ll Do

Prototype and iterate on gameplay mechanics, modes, or systems using Unreal Engine 5 and internal design tools.

Contribute to feature design docs, flowcharts, and balance sheets under the guidance of senior designers.

Conduct playtests and capture actionable feedback to refine mechanics and user experience.

Work cross-disciplinarily with engineers, artists, and UX to ensure designs translate cleanly from concept to implementation.

Explore player data and telemetry to evaluate balance, retention, and fun.

Present your design work to cross-team stakeholders at mid- and end-of-internship reviews.

What We’re Looking For

Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Game Design, Computer Science, Interactive Media, or related field.

Graduation date between May 2026 – July 2027.

Strong grasp of systems thinking, level design, and the fundamentals of gameplay balance.

Familiarity with Unreal Engine (Blueprints or scripting).

Ability to communicate design ideas clearly through documentation and verbal presentation.

Collaborative spirit — willing to learn from critique and iterate fast.

Bonus Skills

Basic understanding of live-service game loops (progression, events, engagement).

Interest in competitive, sandbox, or shooter genres.

Prior modding, game-jam, or indie-prototype experience.

Why Epic?

You’ll work inside the same ecosystem that powers Fortnite, Rocket League, and Unreal Engine 5. You’ll learn to design at the intersection of creativity and real-time technology — surrounded by a company that treats interns as full teammates, not assistants.

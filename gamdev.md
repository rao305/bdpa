Robotics Software Intern — NVIDIA (AI & Simulation)
Location: Santa Clara, CA | Hybrid
Program Duration: 12 Weeks | Summer 2026
Reports to: Senior Research Scientist, Robotics AI

About the Role
At NVIDIA, we’re building the brains of intelligent machines. As a Robotics Software Intern, you’ll help develop AI-based motion planning, perception, and simulation tools used by developers and researchers worldwide. You’ll work on cloud-scale simulation and reinforcement learning pipelines that enable robots to learn and adapt safely in virtual environments before they touch the real world.

What You’ll Do
Design and implement robotic simulation scenarios using Isaac Sim and Omniverse Kit.

Develop or optimize AI-based control algorithms (e.g., path planning, imitation learning).

Collect and process synthetic datasets for perception model training (vision, depth, LiDAR).

Work with GPU-accelerated compute libraries for real-time physics or control.

Collaborate with ML researchers to benchmark models in sim-to-real pipelines.

Present findings and results at internal research demos or publications.

What We’re Looking For
Pursuing a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, Robotics, or Applied Mathematics.

Strong proficiency in Python + C++, and comfort with PyTorch / TensorFlow.

Knowledge of robot kinematics, motion planning, and control theory.

Familiarity with ROS 2 and Isaac Sim / Gazebo / Unity robotics environments.

Strong linear algebra and probability background (for sensor fusion, optimization).

Bonus Skills
Experience with CUDA, RL frameworks (e.g., RLlib, Isaac Gym).

Contributions to open-source robotics or ML projects.

Research experience in sim-to-real transfer or vision-based control.

Why NVIDIA?
You’ll help power the future of autonomous systems by working at the intersection of robotics, AI, and simulation — on the same platforms that enable self-driving cars, factory automation, and humanoid robotics.
